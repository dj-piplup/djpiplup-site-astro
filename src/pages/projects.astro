          title="PasteQR"

          github="https://github.com/dj-piplup/qr-paste"
        >
          Plain old QR code parser, but unlike a lot of what comes up first on
          Google/DuckDuckGo, you can just paste an image from the clipboard
          instead of needing to save and upload
        </Project>
        <Project
          title="FFXIV Zodiac Book Router"
          website="https://zodiac-router.djpiplup.dev/"
          github="https://github.com/dj-piplup/xiv-book-router"
        >
          Creates checkable to-do list for the Trials of the Braves step in the
          FFXIV Zodiac Weapons questline, bundling tasks by location rather than
          type. The locations can additionally be sorted to optimize gil costs,
          if that matters
        </Project>
        <Project
          title="HoloCure Randomizer"
          website="https://qrpaste.djpiplup.dev/"
          github="https://github.com/dj-piplup/holocure-randomizer"
        >
          Randomly picks a HoloCure character from the ones in the game. This
          was made during version 0.6, where the random character option didn't
          exist. This option exists again in 0.7, but I have decided to maintain
          the randomizer site anyway, for visibility
        </Project>
        <Project
          title="HoloCure Buddy"
          github="https://github.com/dj-piplup/holocure-buddy-tauri"
          download="https://github.com/dj-piplup/holocure-buddy-tauri/releases/latest"
        >
          A desktop app that acts as a live completion tracker for HoloCure
          stage completion and Fan Letters. This also includes a randomizer,
          which can automatically filter the random pool by your choice of
          completion goal

        <Project
          title="Nimi Nightmare Birthday Card"
          website="https://happybirthday.naplings.net/"
        >
          For Nimi's 2025 birthday, I created a free alternative to kudoboard
          for a smaller napling community to put together a 'Birthday Card' of
          sorts. Not the best layout I've done, but I'm glad I got to directly
          support hundreds of people with this project
